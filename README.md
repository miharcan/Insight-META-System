# Insight-META-System

The META (MachinE TranslAtion) System allows access to the SMT decoder through an API request.

This can be performed in two ways:

* adding lines of code into own source code (using the library InsightTranslate.pm)
* calling the script Translate.pm with a command (sending arguments the library InsightTranslate.pm)
